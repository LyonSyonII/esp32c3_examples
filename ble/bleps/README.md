# bleps - A toy-level BLE peripheral stack

This is a BLE peripheral stack in Rust. (no-std / no-alloc)

To use it you need an implementation of embedded-io offering communication with HCI.

The goal is just to have _something_ that works for testing,demos and personal projects - no intentions to make this pass certification tests.
